Description:
There are two funcionalities in this program. The first is a file scrambler which takes a text file 
and saves it as a scrambled bin file. The second is a file descrambler which reads in the scrambled bin 
file and descrambles it back to a text file. There is a GUI interface that selects the file to be converted
and contains two push bottons and two corresponding QTextEdits. The first button runs the file scrambler code
and displays the scrambled file on the first QTextEdit. The second button calls the descrambler program and
then displays the descrambled code on the second QTextEdit.
